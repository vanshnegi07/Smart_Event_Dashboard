<h1>Event Dashboard</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>
This is a simple project made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I made it while learning basic frontend concepts and trying to understand how JavaScript works with user input and buttons.
</p>
<p>
In this project, a user can add events and see them displayed on the page as cards. It is a beginner level project and was made mainly for practice.

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>
- Add event name, date, category and description<br>
- Events appear on the screen as cards<br>
- Mark an event as completed<br>
- Delete any event easily<br>
</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>
User enters the event details and clicks on the add button. After that, JavaScript creates a new event card and shows it on the page.  
Each card has two buttons:

</p>
